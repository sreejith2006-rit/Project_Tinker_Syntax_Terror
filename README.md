### 🔮 Project Description
KaiVismayam uses advanced image recognition and voice technology to analyze the lines on your palm. 
Our system interprets the unique patterns and provides a personalized reading, delivered through an engaging audio experience. 
### 🚫 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are walking around not knowing what their palms say about their love life, career, or pet ownership. 
This is a serious gap in the modern digital lifestyle.Simply upload a clear image of your palm, and let KaiVismayam reveal the secrets held within your hand.
